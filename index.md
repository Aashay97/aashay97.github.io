Hi, I'm Aashay.

I work at EdgeVerve. My current project involves designing and implementing the new microservices architecture for payments in [Finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/), our flagship product used by banks in 100+ countries.

Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at BITS Pilani. For my undergraduate thesis, I was fortunate enough to have been advised by Dr. Falk Lieder at MPI-IS.

I am interested in the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm and its applications. I love chess, football (soccer), traveling, outdoor activities, board games, music, and, especially, understated humor. 

Note: The website is still under construction. You can have a look at my reasonably up-to-date [CV](./assets/pdf/cv.pdf), meanwhile.
