Hi, I'm Aashay.

I'm current a Software Developer at EdgeVerve.

I am interested in the field of Reinforcement Learning and its applications. I love chess, football (soccer), travelling, outdoor activities, board games, music, and, especially, understated humor. 

Note: The website is still under construction. Have a look at my reasonably updated [CV](./assets/pdf/cv.pdf), meanwhile.
