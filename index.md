Hi, I'm Aashay.

I'm a Member of Technical Staff at EdgeVerve. In my current project, I have been involved in designing and implementing the new microservices architecture for payments in [Finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/), our flagship product used by banks in 100+ countries.

Previously, I earned my bachelor degree in Computer Science at BITS Pilani. For my thesis, I was fortunate enough to be advised by Dr. Falk Lieder at MPI-IS.

I am interested in the field of Reinforcement Learning and its applications. I love chess, football (soccer), travelling, outdoor activities, board games, music, and, especially, understated humor. 

Note: The website is still under construction. Have a look at my reasonably up-to-date [CV](./assets/pdf/cv.pdf), meanwhile.
