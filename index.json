The theory of resource-rationality makes it possible to leverage machine learning to discover optimal heuristics automatically.  One bottleneck of this approach is that the resulting decision strategies are only as good as the model of the decision-problem that the machine learning methods were applied to. This is problematic because even domain experts cannot give complete and fully accurate descriptions of the decisions they face. To address this problem we develop strategy discovery methods that are robust to model misspecification. The basic idea is to derive the strategy that will perform best in expectation across all possible real-world problems that could have given rise to the likely erroneous description that a domain expert provided.  To achieve this, our method uses a probabilistic model of model-misspecification to perform Bayesian inference on what the real-world problem might be like. We applied our Bayesian approach to robust strategy discovery in two domains - planning and risky choice.  In both applications we find that our approach leads to more robust strategies and that teaching those strategies to people significantly improves their performance in scenarios where approaches ignoring the risk of model-misspecification are ineffective or even harmful.  The methods developed in this article are an important step towards leveraging machine learning to improve human decision-making in the real world because they tackle the problem that the real world is fundamentally uncertain.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging machine learning to automatically derive robust decision strategies from imperfect models of the real world","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aashay Mehta","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Since a human’s perception of the world is inaccurate due to inherent cognitive biases, it would be naive to assume that their description of the decision problem is accurate. What should we do then? Incorporate our knowledge about these biases in our RL algorithms!\nTo that end, I ran experiments to capture potentially erroneous accounts, mathematically modeled the cognitive biases, and employed Bayesian Inference to obtain the posterior distribution of the actual environment structure. I then utilized this posterior to better the strategy-discovery methods.

We can leverage machine learning to discover clever strategies automatically. Current methods require an accurate model of the decision problems people face in real life. But most models are misspecified because of limited information and cognitive biases. To address this problem we develop strategy discovery methods that are robust to model misspecification. Robustness is achieved by modeling model-misspecification and handling uncertainty about the real-world according to Bayesian inference. We translate our methods into an intelligent tutor that automatically discovers and teaches robust planning strategies. Our robust cognitive tutor significantly improved human decision-making when the model was so biased that conventional cognitive tutors were no longer effective. These findings highlight that our robust strategy discovery methods are a significant step towards leveraging artificial intelligence to improve human decision-making in the real world.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging Machine Learning to Automatically Derive Robust Planning Strategies from Biased Models of the Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"aa0eda70a439f6cca794cdd417d605ea","permalink":"https://aashay97.github.io/project/compiler-construction/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/compiler-construction/","section":"project","summary":"Created a compiler for a strongly-typed language that generated assembly code","tags":["Programming Languages"],"title":"Compiler in C","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
