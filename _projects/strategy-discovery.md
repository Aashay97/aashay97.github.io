Robust Strategy Discovery
============

The goal in this project was to discover strategies for real-world problems and then teach them to people. Since a human's perception of the world is inaccurate due to inherent cognitive biases, it would be naive to assume that the decision-problem is exactly as described by them. What should we do then? Incorporate our knowledge about these biases in our RL algorithms!

This project formed my undergraduate thesis under Dr. Falk Lieder at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tuebingen, Germany. More on the project [homepage](https://re.is.mpg.de/research_projects/robust-strategy-discovery).
