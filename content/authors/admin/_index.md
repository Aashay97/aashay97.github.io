I am interested in the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and its real-world applications. For my undergraduate thesis in this domain, I was fortunate enough to have been advised by Dr. Falk Lieder at MPI-IS. 

My current project at Edgeverve involves designing and implementing a microservices architecture for payments in [Finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/), our product used by banks in 100+ countries.

<!-- I am interested in the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm and its applications. I love chess, football (soccer), traveling, outdoor activities, board games, music, and, especially, understated humor.  -->

Note: The website is still under construction. You can have a look at my reasonably up-to-date {{< staticref "uploads/cv.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}}, meanwhile.
